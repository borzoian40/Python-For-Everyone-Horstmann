time. Groups of people can always leave the bar, but a group cannot enter the bar 
if they would make the number of people in the bar exceed the maximum of 100 
occupants. Write a program that readsthe sizes of the groupsthat arrive or depart.
Use negative numbers for departures. After each input, display the current number 
of occupants. As soon as the bar holds the maximum number of people, report that 
the bar is full and exit the program
