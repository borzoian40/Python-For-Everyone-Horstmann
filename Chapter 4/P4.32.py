•• Business P4.32 Your company has shares of stock it would like to sell when their value exceeds a 
certain target price. Write a program that reads the target price and then reads the 
current stock price until it is at least the target price. Your program should read
a sequence of floating-point values from standard input. Once the minimum is 
reached, the program should report that the stock price exceeds the target price.
