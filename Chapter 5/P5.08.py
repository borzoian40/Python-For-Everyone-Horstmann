P5.08
•• P5.8 It is a well-known phenomenon that most people are easily able to read a text whose 
words have two characters flipped, provided the first and last letter of each word are 
not changed. For example,
I dn’ot gvie a dman for a man taht can olny sepll a wrod one way. (Mrak Taiwn)
Write a function scramble(word) that constructs a scrambled version of a given word,
randomly flipping two characters other than the first and last one. Then write a 
program that reads words and prints the scrambled words.
