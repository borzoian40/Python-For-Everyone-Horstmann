#First Approach
#Create a new function called greeting
def greeting():
    return "Welcome!! Wishing you the best things in every second of your life!"

#Print the given function
print(greeting())

#Second Approach:
def main():
    greeting = "Hello there!!!"
    print(greeting)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
