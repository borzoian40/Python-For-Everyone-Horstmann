••• P6.13 Write a function def sameElements(a, b) that checks whether two lists have the same 
elements in some order, with the same multiplicities. For example,
1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
and
11 1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9
would be considered identical, but
1 4 9 16 9 7 4 9 11
and
11 11 7 9 16 4 1 4 9
would not. You will probably need one or more helper functions
